This is an audio file converter that converts various audio formats into .mp3 files compatible with the PSP. 
This tool was created primarily for fun and as a learning experience to learn how audio decoding, encoding,
and metadata work. It was also a learning experience to learn how to use the egui library, and writing
shaders for it. 

The project is based on the [emilk/eframe_template](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template).
